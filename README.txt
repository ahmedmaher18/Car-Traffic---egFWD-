The project goal is to create functioning car traffic light and when the push button is pressed pedestrian 
traffic shall be functioning as well with the car traffic.
The car traffic is running in normal mode which is 
green -> yellow blinking -> red-> yellow blinking-> green with delay of 5 seconds between each light. 
When the push button is pressed the pedestrian mode becomes active which implements both the car 
traffic and pedestrian traffic simultaneously so that if the button was pressed when the car traffic light was 
green or yellow it will immediately begin blinking both yellow lights for 5 seconds starting from when 
the button was pressed and then turn on green pedestrian traffic and red car traffic for 5 seconds then get 
back to yellow blinking for 5 seconds then the green car traffic will turn on and turn on pedestrian red 
traffic light and it stays this way until the push button is pressed again.
If the button was pressed when the car light was red it will keep it on and turn the green pedestrian green 
traffic for 5 seconds starting from when the button was pressed. Then the two yellow lights will be 
blinking for 5 seconds then the car traffic will return to normal mode from green traffic and the pedestrian 
traffic will remain red until someone pushes the button again
